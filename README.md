-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

### Use the Starter (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axior-agents/axior.git

cp .env.example .env

pnpm i && pnpm start
```

### Manually Start Axior (Only recommended if you know what you are doing)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/axior-agents/axior.git

# Checkout the latest release
# This project iterates fast, so we recommend checking out the latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
```

### Start Axior with Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/axior-agents/Axior/tree/main)

### Edit the .env file

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: .env is optional. If your planning to run multiple distinct agents, you can pass secrets through the character JSON

### Automatically Start Axior

This will run everything to setup the project and start the bot with the default character.

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

### Edit the character file

1. Open `agent/src/character.ts` to modify the default character. Uncomment and edit.

2. To load custom characters:
    - Use `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"`
    - Multiple character files can be loaded simultaneously
3. Connect with X (Twitter)
    - change `"clients": []` to `"clients": ["twitter"]` in the character file to connect with X

### Manually Start Axior

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm start

# The project iterates fast, sometimes you need to clean the project if you are coming back to the project
pnpm clean
```

#### Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```
